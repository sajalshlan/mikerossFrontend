Analyze the following documents for two tasks:
    1. Determine if there is at least one common party present in all documents.
    2. If there is at least one common party, perform a conflict check across all documents.

    For each document, identify any clauses or terms that may conflict with clauses or terms in the other documents.

    Provide your analysis in the following format:
    Common Party Check:
    [Yes/No] - There [is/are] [a common party/no common parties] involved across the selected documents.

    If the answer is Yes, continue with:

    (IMPORTANT NOTE: If yes, start your response from here)

    - [Name of common party 1]
    - [Name of common party 2]
    - ...


    Conflict Analysis:

    Conflicts:
    1. Clause [X] conflicts with [Filename2], Clause [Y]:
       - [Brief explanation of the conflict]
    2. ...

    Document: [Filename2](send this in your response with a special tag like **Document Name**)
    Conflicts:
    1. ...

    If no conflicts are found for a document, state "No conflicts found."

    If there is no common party, only provide the Common Party Check result.

    Focus on significant conflicts that could impact the legal or business relationship between the parties involved.
